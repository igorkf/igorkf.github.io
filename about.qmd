Originally from São Paulo, SP, Brazil, Portuguese native speaker, but now living in Arkansas, US. After working for some time in the industry right after high school, I decided to start a bachelor's degree in Statistics at the Federal University of Goiás (Brazil's midwest), wherein in my last two years I was an undergraduate researcher at Embrapa Rice and Beans [^1]. We analyzed agricultural data and tried to make sense of environmental drivers in the yield of rice and beans and I started to like to work with agricultural statistics. Now I'm doing a master's degree in Statistics and Analytics at the University of Arkansas.

[^1]: The Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation in charge of coordinating research and development of rice and beans, two crops that are extensively grown in Brazil.

My first programming language was C, followed by R and Python.
