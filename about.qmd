Originally from SÃ£o Paulo, SP, Brazil, I speak Portuguese (pt-br ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·), but now I'm living in Arkansas, US. After working for some time in the industry right after high school, I decided to start a bachelor's degree in Statistics at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s (Brazil's midwest), wherein in my last two years I was an undergraduate researcher at Embrapa Rice and Beans ^[the Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation in charge of coordinating research and development of rice and beans, two crops that are extensively grown in Brazil.]. We analyzed agricultural data and tried to make sense of environmental drivers in the yield of rice and beans and I started to like to work with agricultural statistics. Now I'm doing a master's degree in Statistics and Analytics at the University of Arkansas.

My first programming language was C, followed by R and Python.
