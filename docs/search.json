    "text": "From the vibrant city of São Paulo in Brazil, I’m a Portuguese native speaker who now calls Arkansas home. I spent some time in the industry after high school before realizing my passion for statistics. This led me to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics from the Federal University of Goiás, where I served as an undergraduate researcher at Embrapa Rice and Beans 1. We used agricultural data to explore how environmental factors impacted the yield of rice and beans. This experience stimulated my interest in agricultural statistics, prompting me to pursue a Master’s degree in Statistics and Analytics from the University of Arkansas.\nStarted with C, then added R and Python to my toolkit. I’ve also used SQL in the past.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nThe Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation in charge of coordinating research and development of rice and beans, two crops that are extensively grown in Brazil.↩︎"
