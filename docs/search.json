    "section": "",
    "text": "Mostly, I have been using the package asreml (The VSNi Team 2023) for fitting genomic prediction models. This year I started to read some papers about fitting GBLUP models. For example, I read the reaction norm paper (Jarquín et al. 2014) and the BGLR package paper (Pérez and Campos 2014). I noticed both papers used the BGLR package, so I wondered if I could get similar results with asreml. This post is an attempt to compare results from BGLR and asreml packages when fitting GBLUP models in single and multi-environment trials (MET)."

In this post, we are going to analyze what happens to the parameters of the linear model, that is, the regression coefficients, when the response variable is centered and scaled. We are also going to see what happens to the variance of the error term.\nDefine the following linear model for \\(y\\), with two covariates \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\): \\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\varepsilon\n\\] with \\(E[\\varepsilon] = 0\\) and \\(Var[\\varepsilon] = \\sigma^2\\).\nNow, define a transformation of the response variable, by centering by \\(a\\) and scaling by \\(b\\): \\[\ny' = \\frac{y - a}{b}\n\\] with \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) known constants.\nThe same model form holds for \\(y'\\): \\[\ny' = \\beta_0' + \\beta_1' x_1 + \\beta_2' x_2\n\\]\nRealizing that \\(y = y'b + a\\), we can substitute it in the first model:\n\\[\ny'b + a = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\varepsilon \\implies\ny' = \\frac{\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x_1 + \\beta_2 x_2 + \\varepsilon - a}{b}\n\\]\nRearranging the terms, we can identify what has changed: \\[\n\\begin{align*}\ny' &= \\underbrace{\\frac{\\beta_0 - a}{b}}_{\\beta_0'} + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{b} \\beta_1}_{\\beta_1'} x_1 + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{b} \\beta_2}_{\\beta_2'} x_2 + \\underbrace{\\frac{1}{b} \\varepsilon}_{\\varepsilon'} \\\\\n&= \\beta_0' + \\beta_1' x_1 + \\beta_2' x_2 + \\varepsilon'\n\\end{align*}\n\\]\nThus, regarding the original model, \\(\\beta_0\\) (the intercept) was centered by \\(a\\) and scaled by \\(b\\), whereas \\(\\beta_1\\) and \\(\\beta_2\\) were scaled by \\(b\\). We can also identify how the variance of the error term has changed: \\[\nVar[\\varepsilon'] = Var\\Big[\\frac{1}{b} \\varepsilon\\Big] = \\frac{1}{b^2} Var[\\varepsilon] = \\frac{1}{b^2} \\sigma^2 = \\sigma'^{ \\ 2}\n\\] So, the variance of the error was scaled by the square of \\(b\\).\nThis idea of this post was only to show the changes in the parameters of the original linear model under the centering and scaling of the response variable. The practical implications of transforming the response variable are beyond the scope of this post, but I think this was an interesting exercise."
