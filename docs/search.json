After working for some time in the industry right after high school, I decided to start a bachelorâ€™s degree in Statistics at the Federal University of GoiÃ¡s (Brazilâ€™s midwest), wherein in my last two years I was an undergraduate researcher at Embrapa Rice and Beans 1. We analyzed agricultural data and tried to make sense of environmental drivers in the yield of rice and beans and I started to like to work with agricultural statistics. Now Iâ€™m doing a masterâ€™s degree in Statistics and Analytics at the University of Arkansas.\nMy first programming language was C, followed by R and Python.\n\n\n\nFootnotes\n\n\nthe Brazilian Agricultural Research Corporation in charge of coordinating research and development of rice and beans, two crops that are extensively grown in Brazil.â†©ï¸Ž"
