The idea here is not to run a full factor analysis and interpret the results, but rather to get to know better the math behind it.\n\nOne reason to run factor analysis is to study the linear association between variables. In factor analysis, we assume that this linear association may exist because the variables are functions of a small group of unobserved variables known as *latent factors*. Let's derive this idea.\n\n# Mathematical notation\n\nConsider we have $p$ variables represented by $X$, and all variables are standardized (centered by their mean, and scaled by their standard deviation), such that each variable has zero mean and unit variance:\n\n$$\nX = \\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\dots x_p\n\\end{bmatrix}^T\n$$\n\nwith mean vector $E[X] = \\mu = [0 \\dots 0]^T$ and covariance matrix $D[X] = \\Sigma$. So, through this post, $D[.]$ will be used to denote the covariance matrix.\n\nDue to the standardization of variables, $D[X]$ has the following properties:\n\ni)  Diagonal values (the variances) are one\n\nii) Off-diagonal (the covariances) are $\\sigma_{ij} = Cov[x_i, x_j] = Corr[x_i, x_j]$ for all $i \\ne j$, because $Corr[x_i, x_j] = \\frac{Cov[x_i, x_j]}{\\sqrt{Var[x_i]} \\sqrt{Var[x_j]}} = \\frac{Cov[x_i, x_j]}{\\sqrt{1} \\sqrt{1}} = Cov[x_i, x_j]$\n\nThis means after standardization we are working with a correlation matrix.\n\nDefine a vector $f$ of random variables that we have not observed:\n\n$$\nf = \\begin{bmatrix}\nf_1 \\dots f_k\n\\end{bmatrix}^T\n$$ with $k \\ll n$ and $k \\ll p$. By now, let's assume we know $k$.\n\nNow we can start relating $X$ with $f$. Each variable $x_i$ is related to $f$ as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx_1 =& L_{11} f_1 + L_{12} f_2 + \\dots + L_{1k} f_k + \\varepsilon_1 \\\\\nx_2 =& L_{21} f_1 + L_{22} f_2 + \\dots + L_{2k} f_k + \\varepsilon_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_p =& L_{p1} f_1 + L_{p2} f_2 + \\dots + L_{pk} f_k + \\varepsilon_p\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere the coefficients multiplying each component of $f$ are fixed unknown parameters that need to be estimated, and $\\varepsilon_1 \\dots \\varepsilon_p$ are random errors. They represent the parts of $x_1 \\dots x_p$ that cannot be linearly explained by $f_1 \\dots f_k$. As you can see, each variable is written as a linear combination of the factors plus a portion not explained by them.\n\nThis system of equations can be represented in a matrix form as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{bmatrix}\nx_1 \\\\\nx_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nx_p\n\\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nL_{11} & L_{12} & \\dots & L_{1k} \\\\\nL_{21} & L_{22} & \\dots & L_{2k} \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \nL_{p1} & L_{p2} & \\dots & L_{pk}\n\\end{bmatrix} \n\\begin{bmatrix}\nf_1 \\\\\nf_2 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nf_k\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThis can be written as:\n\n$$\nX = L f + \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nwhere $X$ is a $p \\times 1$ vector, $L$ is a $p \\times k$ matrix, $f$ is a $k \\times 1$ vector, and $\\varepsilon$ is a $p \\times 1$ vector. The $L$ matrix is known as the *loading matrix* and the $f$ vector is known as the *factor scores*.\n\nNotice that all terms in the right-hand side of the equation are unknown, where $L$ is a matrix of fixed unknown parameters (that we need to estimate) and $f$ and $\\varepsilon$ are unknown random vectors.\n\nFurther assumptions for $f$ and $\\varepsilon$ are:\n\n$$\nE[f] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\dots 0\n\\end{bmatrix}^T, \\ D[f] = I_k\n$$\n\nNotice that $D[f] = I_k$ implies that the factors are uncorrelated as we want to explain the linear correlation of $X$ variables using a set of non-correlated latent factors, otherwise the interpretation would be confounded. We further have that:\n\n$$\nE[\\varepsilon] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n0 \\dots 0\n\\end{bmatrix}^T, \\ D[\\varepsilon] = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sigma_1^2 & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\sigma_2^2 & \\dots & 0\\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \n0 & 0 & \\dots & \\sigma_p^2 \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nThe last assumption is that $f$ and $\\varepsilon$ are independent.\n\n# The correlation matrix\n\nAs stated in the beginning, we want to study the correlation between the variables, but using the equation we derived for $X$ that involves $L$ and $f$. This correlation will be denoted as $\\Sigma$. From some properties of covariances, we have that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Sigma =& D[X] = D[Lf + \\varepsilon] = Cov[Lf + \\varepsilon, Lf + \\varepsilon] \\\\\n=& \\underbrace{Cov[Lf, Lf]}_{D[Lf]} + \\underbrace{Cov[Lf, \\varepsilon]}_0 + \\underbrace{Cov[\\varepsilon, Lf]}_0 + \\underbrace{Cov[\\varepsilon, \\varepsilon]}_{D[\\varepsilon]} \\\\\n=& D[Lf] + D[\\varepsilon] = L D[f] L^T + D[\\varepsilon] = L I_k L^T + D[\\varepsilon] \\\\\n=& LL^T + D[\\varepsilon]\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nAbove, two terms are zero because we assumed $f$ and $\\varepsilon$ are independent.\n\nRemember that each variable has zero mean and unit variance, so all diagonal values of $\\Sigma$ are one. It turns out there are some interesting results arising from the diagonal values of $\\Sigma$. Let $\\Sigma_{ii}$ represent the i-th diagonal value from $\\Sigma$, so:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Sigma_{ii} =& Var[x_i] = (LL^T + D[\\varepsilon])_{ii} = 1 \\implies \\\\ \n& (LL^T)_{ii} + \\underbrace{(D[\\varepsilon])_{ii}}_{\\sigma_i^2} = 1 \\implies \\\\\n& (LL^T)_{ii} + \\sigma_i^2 = 1\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNote we can represent the i-th diagonal value from $LL^T$ as a dot product of $L$'s i-th row:\n\n$$\n(LL^T)_{ii} = \\begin{bmatrix}\nL_{i1} \\ L_{i2} \\dots L_{ik}\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\nL_{i1} \\\\\nL_{i2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nL_{ik}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nPlugging in into the result from before, we have:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\Sigma_{ii} =& \\begin{bmatrix}\nL_{i1} \\ L_{i2} \\dots L_{ik}\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\nL_{i1} \\\\\nL_{i2} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nL_{ik}\n\\end{bmatrix} + \\sigma_i^2 = 1 \\implies \\\\\n& L_{i1}^2 + L_{i2}^2 + \\dots + L_{ik}^2 + \\sigma_i^2 = 1 \\implies \\\\\n\\sigma_i^2 &= 1 - (L_{i1}^2 + L_{i2}^2 + \\dots + L_{ik}^2)\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis means that if we estimate $L$, we can easily find $D[\\varepsilon]$. Arranging the result above, we have:\n\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\sigma_i^2}_{\\text{non-negative}} + \\ \\underbrace{L_{i1}^2 + L_{i2}^2 + \\dots + L_{ik}^2}_{\\text{non-negative}} = 1\n$$\n\nAs both quantities are non-negative, and they sum to one, we can think of them as two proportions (e.g., $30\\% + 70\\% = 1$ or $84\\% + 16\\% = 1$).\n\n<!-- From above, two inequalities hold: -->\n\n<!-- $$ -->\n\n<!-- 0 \\le \\sigma_i^2 \\le 1 \\ \\text{and} \\ 0 \\le L_{i1}^2 + L_{i2}^2 + \\dots + L_{ik}^2 \\le 1 -->\n\n<!-- $$ -->\n\nAs $\\Sigma = D[X] = LL^T + D[\\varepsilon]$, where the i-th diagonal of $\\Sigma$ is $Var[x_i]$, we have that:\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{ii} = Var[x_i] = 1 = \\underbrace{L_{i1}^2 + L_{i2}^2 + \\dots + L_{ik}^2}_{\\text{A}} + \\underbrace{\\sigma_i^2}_{\\text{B}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\text{A}$ is the proportion of $Var[x_i]$ explained by the factors, also known as *communality* of $x_i$ and $\\text{B}$ is the proportion of $Var[x_i]$ **not** explained by the factors, known as *specific variance* of $Var[x_i]$. Of course, this result holds for all the variances $Var[x_1], Var[X_2], \\dots, Var[x_p]$. As [Dr. Peyam](https://www.youtube.com/@drpeyam) would say, \"how cool is that?!\". We can partition the variance of each variable in two parts.\n\n<!-- It can be shown that: -->\n\n<!-- i) for any $(i, j)$, $L_{ij}^2$ is the proportion of $Var[x_i]$ explained by the $j-th$ factor -->\n\n<!-- ii) for any $i$, the sum of squares of the i-th row of $L$ represent the proportion of $Var[x_i]$ explained by all factors together -->\n\n<!-- iii) for any $j$, the sum of squares of entries of j-th column of $L$ represent the total variability of all $p$ variables explained by the j-th factor -->\n\n# One property of the loading matrix\n\nThere are many properties of the loading matrix $L$, and they are used when performing a factor analysis, but let's focus in one particular result. Pick any two variables, e.g., the i-th and the j-th, with $i \\neq j$. As defined previously:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nx_i =& L_{i1} f_1 + L_{i2} f_2 + \\dots + L_{ik} + \\varepsilon_i \\\\\nx_j =& L_{j1} f_1 + L_{j2} f_2 + \\dots + L_{jk} + \\varepsilon_j\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSo, what is the correlation between $x_i$ and $x_j$ in terms of $L$? To derive this result, we can first compute its covariance, and then its correlation:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nCov[x_i, x_j] &= Cov[\n  L_{i1} f_1 + L_{i2} f_2 + \\dots + L_{ik} + \\varepsilon_i,\n  L_{j1} f_1 + L_{j2} f_2 + \\dots + L_{jk} + \\varepsilon_j\n] \\\\ \n&= \\text{Sum of covariances of all pairwise combinations}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nMany terms of this sum will disappear because:\n\n-   $D[f] = I_k$, so any pair involving two different factors $f_i$ and $f_j$ will be uncorrelated\n\n-   $f$ and $\\varepsilon$ were assumed to be independent, so any pair involving one factor and one member of $\\varepsilon$ will be uncorrelated\n\n-   $D[\\varepsilon]$ is a diagonal matrix, so any pair of different members of $\\varepsilon$ will be uncorrelated\n\nThus, the only non-zero terms are those involving the same pair of factors:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nCov[x_i, x_j] &= Cov[L_{i1} f_1, L_{j1} f_1] + Cov[L_{i2} f_2, L_{j2} f_2] + \\dots + Cov[L_{ik} f_k, L_{jk} f_k] \\\\\n&= L_{i1} Cov[f_1, f_1] L_{j1} + L_{i2} Cov[f_2, f_2] L_{j2} + \\dots + L_{ik} Cov[f_k, f_k] L_{jk} \\\\\n&= L_{i1} Var[f_1] L_{j1} + L_{i2} Var[f_2] L_{j2} + \\dots + L_{ik} Var[f_k] L_{jk} \\\\\n&= L_{i1} L_{j1} + L_{i2} L_{j2} + \\dots + L_{ik} L_{jk}\n\\end{align*}\n$$ because $D[f] = I_k$, so $Var[f_1] = Var[f_2] = \\dots = Var[f_k] = 1$. Now, the result above means that:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nCov[x_i, x_j] &= L_{i1} L_{j1} + L_{i2} L_{j2} + \\dots + L_{ik} L_{jk} \\\\\n&= \\text{Dot product between i-th and j-th rows of L} \\\\\n&= L_{i*}^T L_{j*}\n\\end{align*}\n$$ Since $Var[x_i] = Var[x_j] = 1$, we have that:\n\n$$\nCorr[x_i, x_j] = \\frac{Cov[x_i, x_j]}{\\sqrt{Var[x_i]} \\sqrt{Var[x_j]}} = \\frac{L_{i*}^T L_{j*}}{\\sqrt{1} \\sqrt{1}} = L_{i*}^T L_{j*}\n$$ So, if we have $L$, calculating $Corr[x_i, x_j]$ is just taking the dot product between i-th and j-th rows of $L$.\n\n# Estimating the loading matrix\n\nThere are many ways to estimate the loading matrix $L$, and here we are going to use a principal component solution, which is also implemented in the `psych` package.\n\nActually, there is no **unique** solution for $L$. To see this, consider any orthogonal matrix $A$, so $AA^T = A^TA = I_k$. Now, rewrite $X$ as:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nX &= Lf + \\varepsilon = L \\underbrace{I_k}_{AA^T} f + \\varepsilon \\\\\n&= \\underbrace{(LA)}_{L^*} \\underbrace{(A^Tf)}_{f^*} + \\varepsilon = L^* f^* + \\varepsilon\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nwhere properties of $f^*$ are still the same as the original $f$ because:\n\n$$\nE[f^*] = E[A^T f] = A^T \\underbrace{E[f]}_{0} = 0\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nD[f^*] = D[A^T f] = A^T D[f] (A^T)^T = A^T I_k A = A^TA = I_k\n$$ So, for any orthogonal matrix $A$, using $X = Lf + \\varepsilon$ or $X = (LA)(A^Tf) + \\varepsilon$ is equivalent.\n\n## The connection between PCA and factor analysis\n\nAs mentioned, we are going to estimate $L$ using a principal components solution. Remember that the principal components representation for $X$, where $X$ is written as a linear combination of the eigenvectors, is:\n\n$$\nZ = A_k (X - \\mu) = A_k X\n$$ because $X$ was standardized, with\n\n$$\nA_k = \\begin{bmatrix}\nu_1^T \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nu_k^T\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nwhere $u_1^T, \\dots, u_k^T$ are the eigenvectors associated with the $k$ largest eigenvalues $\\lambda_{(1)}, \\dots, \\lambda_{(k)}$ of $D[X] = \\Sigma$. Also, the variance of each principal component is $\\lambda_{(i)}$, and the principal components are uncorrelated, so:\n\n$$\nD[Z] = \n\\begin{bmatrix}\n\\lambda_{(1)} & 0 & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n0 & \\lambda_{(2)} & \\dots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ \n0 & 0 & \\dots & \\lambda_{(k)}\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nLet $X_R$ represent the reconstruction of $X$ after performing PCA with $k$ components. It can be shown that this reconstruction is:\n\n$$\nX_R = \\mu + A_K^T Z = A_k^T Z\n$$\n\nSo, we can think of $X$ as a reconstruction plus an error of reconstruction:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nX &= X_R + Error \\\\\n&= A_k^T Z + Error \\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nThis form is very similar to the latent factor model we derived before:\n\n$$\nX = L f + \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nwhere $A_k^T$ would be the analogous of $L$ and $Z$ the analogous of $f$. However, $Z$ cannot be used as $f$ because although $E[f] = E[Z] = 0$, their covariance matrices are different, that is, $D[f] = I_k \\neq D[Z]$. To solve this, we can rescale $Z$ using the eigenvalues. Denote this rescaled version of $Z$ as $Z^*$:\n\n$$\nZ^* = \\begin{bmatrix}\nz_1 / \\sqrt{\\lambda_{(1)}} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nz_k / \\sqrt{\\lambda_{(k)}} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nWe still have $E[Z^*] = E[Z] = 0$ and now, for every $i = 1, \\dots, k$:\n\n$$\nVar\\Big[\\frac{z_i}{\\sqrt{\\lambda_{(i)}}}\\Big] = \\frac{1}{(\\sqrt{\\lambda_{(i)}})^2} Var[z_i] = \\frac{\\lambda_{(i)}}{\\lambda_{(i)}} = 1\n$$\n\nand, as $z_i$ and $z_j$ are uncorrelated, so is $z_i^* = z_i / \\lambda_{(i)}$ and $z_j^* = z_j / \\lambda_{(j)}$. Therefore, $D[Z^*] = I_k = D[f]$. Thus, we have that $Z^*$ and $f$ share the same properties.\n\nComing back to $X$ after performing PCA, we need to rearrange the equation until we move from $Z$ to $Z^*$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\nX =& A_k^T Z + Error \\\\\n=& \\begin{bmatrix}\nu_1^T \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nu_k^T \n\\end{bmatrix}^T \\begin{bmatrix}\nz_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nz_k\n\\end{bmatrix} + Error \\\\\n=& \\begin{bmatrix}\nu_1 \\dots u_k \n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\nz_1 \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nz_k\n\\end{bmatrix} + Error \\\\\n=& \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{\\lambda_{(1)}} u_1 \\dots \\sqrt{\\lambda_{(k)}} u_k\n\\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix}\nz_1 / \\sqrt{\\lambda_{(1)}} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nz_k / \\sqrt{\\lambda_{(k)}} \\\\\n\\end{bmatrix} + Error \\\\\n=& \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{\\lambda_{(1)}} u_1 \\dots \\sqrt{\\lambda_{(k)}} u_k\n\\end{bmatrix} Z^* + Error\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nMatch this result against the factor latent model $X = Lf + \\varepsilon$. We can see that $Z^*$ is playing the role of $f$, in which $Z^*$ and $f$ have same the mean and covariance, and the vector pre-multiplying $Z^*$ is playing the role of $L$. Thus, the solution for $L$ is:\n\n$$\nL = \\begin{bmatrix}\n\\sqrt{\\lambda_{(1)}} u_1 \\dots \\sqrt{\\lambda_{(k)}} u_k\n\\end{bmatrix}\n$$\n\nSo, to estimate $L$ we need to compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of $X$, and then construct $L$ using the square root of the $k$ largest eigenvalues associated with their eigenvectors.\n\n# Computing the latent factors\n\nThere are different ways of computing the latent factors, and here we are going to use the Bartlett's method, which is also implemented in the package `psych`. It can be shown that the vector of latent factors (or factor scores) for the i-th observation can be computed as:\n\n$$\nf^{(i)} = (L^T D[\\varepsilon]^{-1} L)^{-1} L^T D[\\varepsilon]^{-1} X^{(i)}\n$$\n\nwhere $X^{(i)}$ is the vector of $p$ variables for the i-th observation of our data. Note that once we have $L$, we can easily find $D[\\varepsilon]$ (as shown before), and, as $D[\\varepsilon]$ is a diagonal matrix, we just need the reciprocal of the diagonal values to compute $D[\\varepsilon]^{-1}$.\n\nAlso, notice that this solution can be seen as a weighted least squares (WLS), with $D[\\varepsilon]$ playing the role of the weight matrix.\n\n# Implementation\n\nNow we are going to implement everything we saw here, and compare the results with the function `psych::fa`. We are going to use the principal components solution for estimating the loading matrix $L$ and Bartlett's method for the latent factors $f$.\n\nWe are going to use a dataset from the `psych` package called `bfi`.

There are plenty of tutorials on the internet to actually run a factor analysis and interpret results, but the point here was to derive the solution for important objects in factor analysis such as the loading matrix, the factor scores, and the covariance of errors.\n\nThere is much more to talk about such as rotations, proportion of explained variance by the factor scores, correlation between original variables and factor scores, and how to choose the number of factors ($k$). However, I think this is enough to get a good grasp of this topic.\n",
